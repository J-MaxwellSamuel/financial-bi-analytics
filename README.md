# Workforce Productivity & Operational Performance for a Financial Services Company

- Company Context (Fictionalized – Manulife Business Model)
- Company Type: Large financial services firm providing insurance, wealth management, and retirement solutions across North America and Asia.

# Business Problem:
Leadership noticed rising operational costs and uneven service levels across regions and departments. Managers lacked a centralized view of:

- Workforce productivity
- Overtime and absenteeism
- Case resolution performance
- Cost efficiency

Data existed across HR systems, operations tools, and finance systems — but reporting was siloed, manual, and slow.

# Goal:
Build a Power BI operational intelligence dashboard that gives leaders real-time visibility into workforce performance and supports staffing, budgeting, and productivity decisions.

## Business Objectives

- Improve workforce productivity by identifying underperforming teams
- Reduce overtime costs while maintaining service levels
- Increase reporting accuracy and automation
- Enable leaders to make data-driven staffing decisions
